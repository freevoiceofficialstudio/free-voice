      At Free Voice, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your
      personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use and
      safeguard your data.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    </p>

    <h2>Voice Data</h2>
    <p>
      Free Voice does <strong>not</strong> store user voice recordings or processed
      audio on any server. All voice processing happens locally on your device.
    </p>

    <h2>Payments</h2>

      Payments are processed securely via Stripe Checkout. Free Voice does not
      store or process your payment details. Stripe may collect information as

      are blocked automatically.

    <h2>User Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
      Users are responsible for how they use AI-generated or modified voices.
      Free Voice must not be used for impersonation, fraud or unlawful activities.
    </p>

    <h2>Policy Updates</h2>

      This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. Continued use of Free Voice
      indicates acceptance of the updated policy.
