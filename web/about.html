    <h1>About Free Voice</h1>

    <p>
      Free Voice is a modern AI-powered voice changing platform designed to help
      users transform their voice in real time for games, calls, voice chats and
      creative projects.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our system allows users to record, upload and convert their voice using
      realistic AI-based voice profiles. Downloaded voices work offline, while
      live voice changing is securely protected behind a premium membership.
    </p>

    <p>
      Free Voice does not store user voice recordings on any server. All voice
      processing happens locally on the user’s device to ensure privacy and
      security.
    </p>

    <p>
      This product is developed and maintained by <strong>Subhan Ahmad</strong>.
      We aim to provide a simple, fast and ethical voice transformation tool
      suitable for both casual and professional use.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Free Voice generates AI-modified voices.
      Users are fully responsible for how they use generated or modified audio.
      The platform must not be used for impersonation, fraud or any illegal
      activities.
